Vim shortcuts
-----------------
The `.vimrc` installs plugins in `~/.vim/plugged` and maps the leader key \<Leader\> to the whitespace.
In addition, some useful shortcuts are defined as follows.

switch to left/right panes
```
<Leader> + hh/ll
```

move the pane to left/right
```
<Leader> + m + h/l
```

turn on/off NerdTree plugin
```
<Leader> + n
```

search one char by Easymotion plugin
```
<Leader> + s
```

delete trialing whitespaces
```
<Leader> + <space>
```

comment/uncomment one line
```
<Leader> + c + c/u
```

add/remove ipdb/pdb breakpoint for python
```
<Leader> + b
```

turn on/off tags
```
<Leader> + t
```

turn on/off GitGutter
